# Hexagonal-Boron-Nitride
 MATLAB code for Thermal Properties of the Boron Vacancy in hBN.
As part of my senior research, I investigated the effects of laser intensities ranging from 1mW to 20mW in increments of 0.5mW on raman spectroscopy. The purpose was to observe the peaks and shifts in flakes of hBN on silicon at 100x magnification.
